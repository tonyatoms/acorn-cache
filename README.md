Bash and other shell scripts I find useful. You may find them useful or not.

## Scripts

- `ggg.zsh` - Git utility to switch to main branch, update from remote, and clean up old branches
- `ipCheck_notif.sh` - Monitors IP address changes and sends macOS notifications when changes are detected
- `tmux-utc.sh` - Displays current UTC time in 12-hour format (useful for tmux status bars)
- `weather.sh` - Fetches and caches weather information from wttr.in with location support
